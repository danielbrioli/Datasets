### Dota 2 Matches 1:

https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches/data is my source for this data.

This dataset was originally generated by Joe Ramir, and then was expanded upon by Devin Anzelmo. The source that originally created/compiled this data was at the time known as yasp, which has since become opendota.

I've cut 4/5ths of the dataset to allow for easy manipulation of the dataset. I'm just using it for some coursework and don't really want to deal with a gig of data I don't really need to illustrate concepts. The match_ids used in this set range from 0 to 9999 (10k total).
